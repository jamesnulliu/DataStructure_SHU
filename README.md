# DataStructure_SHU
This project provides codes for data structure learning based on Shanghai University's teaching material with a **more-"C++"** style.

The codes are borrowed from *Data Structures, Algorithms, and Applications in C++ Second Edition*, by Sartaj Sahni.

I've made quite a number of changes and added as many comments as I can to help anyone who wants to learn these data structures.
